            <p class="funParagraph">Here I created a couple hypothesis models to determine what makes the best movies.</p>

               <p class="funParagraph">Below is a summary graph comparing movies and revenues. My hypothesis model determined that the MPAA rating of movies does significantly affect how much revenue a movie makes</p>
